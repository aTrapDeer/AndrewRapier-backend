# Andrew Rapier Portfolio Backend
## This is the backend for the portfolio website
### Golang Backend
This is a simple backend written in Golang. It uses the gorm ORM to interact with the database. It also uses the JWT library to handle authentication and authorization.

I typically work mostly in just a Python backend, but maybe this route might be better, I don't know quite yet. Its a fun test case.

Still learning and working with Golang, so this is a bit of a mess or rookie code. Will probably improve it over time.
